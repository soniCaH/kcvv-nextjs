/**
 * The parse for a PSD match date, which is **not** a true instant. The BFF
 * builds it with `Date.UTC(…)` straight from PSD's Belgian local kickoff
 * string (`apps/api/src/psd/transforms.ts` · `parseDateString`), so the Date's
 * UTC fields already *are* Belgian wall-clock. Reading them off UTC is
 * therefore the pin; putting one through `toDisplayZone` adds a phantom
 * +1/+2h and rolls a ≥22:00 kickoff onto the next day.
 *
 * Two data sources, opposite conventions — check which one you hold before
 * zoning it. Sanity `event` datetimes are real UTC instants (`toDisplayZone`);
 * anything reached through a BFF `Match` is wall-clock (this).
 *
 * `keepLocalTime` carries the wall clock across to the club zone instead of
 * leaving the result sitting in UTC. `toFormat` and `toISODate` read the same
 * either way, but the returned DateTime is now a *correct instant* too — so
 * `toISO()`, `toMillis()` and a comparison against `Date.now()` all mean what
 * they say, which matters the moment one of these feeds an ICS or JSON-LD.
 *
 * Accepts the serialised form as well, because `/kalender` carries its matches
 * as `date.toISOString()` — reading that back through `toDisplayZone` is the
 * same defect one `JSON.stringify` later.
 *
 * **Why this is a docblock and not a branded type.** Weighed and declined in
 * #2601. A brand on `Match.date` in `@kcvv/api-contract` would have to survive
 * the trip to the surface that renders it, and it does not: `ScheduleMatch`,
 * `UpcomingMatch` and `MatchHeroProps` would each have to adopt it,
 * `CalendarMatch` cannot — it carries its date as a `string` — and the very
 * first mapper drops it anyway (`components/match/transform.ts` assigns
 * `date: match.date` straight across, silently widening the brand away). So the
 * brand would guard the one place already holding the invariant and none of the
 * places that lose it. What holds it instead: two differently-*named* parses,
 * formatters named after the source they read, and rule 3 of
 * `src/app/__tests__/cross-page-consistency.test.ts`, which fails any parse
 * that names no zone at all.
