/**
 * `<Skeleton>` — the one primitive every loading skeleton composes a shimmer

 *
 * It owns three things no call site may repeat by hand, because a per-div
 * opt-in is exactly how they went missing — wrong in 13 files (fill) and 13
 * files (the `motion-safe:` gate) of the pre-#2573 audit:
 *
 * - **Fill.** `paper-edge` on cream — the only one of six fills in production
 *   use far enough from the `#f5f1e6` cream field for `animate-pulse`'s 50%
 *   opacity fade to actually register (a `cream-soft` bar landed on a 4-unit
 *   colour shift, invisible). A matching translucent-cream tone for the dark
 *   field, and `ink/15` for the `cream-deep` field — the value this call
 *   site used before the primitive existed, kept because it is the one that
 *   was actually calibrated against `cream-deep`.
 * - **The `motion-safe:` gate** on `animate-pulse`, so a shimmer never
 *   animates under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
 * - **`aria-hidden="true"`**, so a bar never gets read by a screen reader —
 *   the loading state's one announcement lives on `<LoadingAnnouncement>`,
 *   never on the bars themselves.
 *
 * `className` supplies sizing and position only — never a fill or animation
 * utility, both already owned here. A card's real chrome (`<TapedCard>`,
 * `border-2 border-ink`, `shadow-paper-*`) stays real; `<Skeleton>` only fills
 * the content slots inside it (#2432 §7).
