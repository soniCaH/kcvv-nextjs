 * it is authored**: every row is derived from a repository read, so a group
 * with no documents behind it is simply not on the page. `llms.txt` shipped
 * `/club/organigram` for months after the route was deleted because it was
 * hand-written; this is the same page built the other way round.
 *
 * Players are deliberately absent and are not an oversight: an index of ~300
 * youth players was rejected on privacy grounds (A7), and of 294 player
 * documents **zero carry a slug** — there would be nothing to link to.
