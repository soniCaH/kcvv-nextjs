/**
 * `<FilterTabsSkeleton>` — the shared filter row's loading footprint.
 *
 * The real row hoisted every filter chip's geometry into one primitive
 * (#2429/#2564); without this, the loading path kept the six places that
 * used to draw it by hand: `/kalender`, `/evenementen`, the homepage's
 * `UpcomingMatches` band, `/nieuws`, both of `/hulp`'s rows, and `/zoeken` —
 * three of which were still modelling the OLD wrapping, per-row-sized chips
 * this branch deleted (#2564 review item 3), because nothing tied the
 * skeleton to the shape it stands in for. A skeleton that disagrees with
 * the thing it stands in for is a layout shift by construction (see
 * `<PageHeroSkeleton>`'s docblock, which named this exact failure mode
 * first).
 *
 * One line, `gap-3`, `h-9` chips — `<FilterTabs>`'s own row shape and chip
 * height, so the swap from skeleton to real content never reflows. Chip
 * widths are fixed placeholders, not per-route data: a placeholder's job is
 * to hold the footprint.
