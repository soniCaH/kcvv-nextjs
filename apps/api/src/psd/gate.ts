/**
 * PSD gate — Effect service over the global {@link GateLogic}.
 *
 * The live layer talks to the `PsdGate` Durable Object (one global instance, see
 * gate-do.ts) so the token bucket and single-flight registry are shared across
 * every worker isolate. The DO class itself lives in a separate module because
 * it imports `cloudflare:workers`, which the Node test env can't resolve — this
 * file must stay importable by the unit tests, so it only references the stub
 * structurally.
 *
 * The gate is **best-effort**: if the DO is unreachable, every operation
 * degrades to "no coordination" (proceed without a token, act as leader) so a
 * gate hiccup never breaks the read path — the KV negative marker + SWR still
 * bound the storm.
