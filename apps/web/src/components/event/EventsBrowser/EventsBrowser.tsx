/**
 * Client shell for the `/evenementen` list (design lock 6e §2 + §4): the
 * colour-coded filter chips above the month-grouped `<TicketStub>` list, plus
 * the empty / filtered-to-zero states, both on the shared tier-"surface"
 * `<EmptyState>` (#2427 / #2562). Single-select, "Alles" default, on the
 * dark `jersey-deep-dark` page — `surface="inverse"` so the card's shadow
 * stays visible against the dark field (round 3 review, A1: the default
 * hard ink shadow is invisible on this ground).
 *
 * The active facet is driven by `useHistoryFilterParam` —
 * `window.history.pushState`, never `useSearchParams` / `router.push`
 * (#2564 review item 2, #2779). This component used to read the URL with
 * `useSearchParams`, which on this static/ISR route forced Next to bail the
 * WHOLE subtree to client-side rendering: the server-rendered HTML shipped
 * only a loading skeleton, thrown away at hydration, and every visitor
 * re-rendered the full month-grouped ticket list client-side from data
 * already sitting in the RSC payload. `"history"` mode (the same mechanism
 * `NewsListingClient.tsx` uses) keeps the AC — filter state is in the URL,
 * browser back undoes a filter — while the page stays fully prerendered: a
 * mount effect seeds a deep-linked `?type=`, which costs one extra render
 * only for a visitor who arrives on one, instead of de-prerendering the
 * page for everyone; a `popstate` listener keeps the row in sync with
 * browser back/forward.
 *
 * - No upcoming events at all → "Nog geen evenementen gepland" (events can
 *   still arrive). The filter row hides — nothing to filter, and showing it
 *   invited a dead-end loop: pick a chip against zero events, land on the
 *   filtered-to-zero copy, undo back to the same emptiness (round 3 review,
 *   C5). This restores the pre-round-2 guard; round 2's own fix (below)
 *   stays independently correct for a facet seeded while the feed is empty
 *   (e.g. a deep link), where the row IS visible on mount.
 * - A type with no upcoming events → names the active category, with the
 *   mandatory "Toon alles" undo — `reason: "filtered"` on `<EmptyState>`,
 *   which makes the undo a compile-time requirement, not a convention.
 *
 * Months whose tickets are all filtered out drop their header automatically —
 * `groupEventsByMonth` only buckets the events `<EventMonthList>` receives.
