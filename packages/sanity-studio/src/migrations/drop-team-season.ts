/**
 * Migration: unset the unused team `season` field (#2567).
 *
 * `season` was declared `readOnly: true` on the `team` schema but never had a
 * writer: it is absent from `PsdTeam` and never written by
 * `psd-sanity-sync.ts`. Measured 2026-08-17: 0 of 26 production team
 * documents (0 of 23 staging) carry a value. The field is dropped from the
 * schema; this migration `unset`s it on any document where it is somehow
 * present so the dataset matches the new schema.
 *
 * Idempotent: docs that have already had the field removed produce zero
 * patches and are left alone.
 *
 * Exported separately from `defineMigration` so unit tests can exercise the
 * branching against synthetic documents without a Sanity dataset.
