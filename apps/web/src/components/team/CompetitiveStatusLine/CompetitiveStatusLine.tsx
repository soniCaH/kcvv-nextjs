  // A permanent PSD read failure (#2636 finding 3) — distinct wording from
  // the line above on purpose, so a genuine pre-season silence is never
  // confused with a broken read. #2433 rule 9's locked failure tell is the
  // full phrase `… is even niet beschikbaar` + `Probeer het later opnieuw` —
  // this site had drifted to `tijdelijk` with no retry line (#2804). Note
  // that "beschikbaar" itself is not reserved vocabulary (#2690's sweep
  // found the empty states each keep their own tell, e.g. "Nog geen …"); the
  // tell is `even` plus the retry sentence, not the word "beschikbaar".
  // Only the string matches #2469 rule 3's accented register (see
  // MatchStandingsSection.tsx / EmptyState.tsx's `reason: "unavailable"`
  // notice) — this line renders through `tier="slot"`'s held-open shape,
  // which has no `emphasis` prop, so the sentence stays unaccented here.
  // Deliberate (EmptyState.tsx's "Not every failure notice on cream goes
  // through this register" note), not a second drift to fix.

/**
 * The `not-in-competition` and `unavailable` states (#2540/#2636 decision) —
 * the competitive half of a team page (`#klassement` + `#wedstrijden`)
 * collapses to a single line rather than two sections that would otherwise
 * render empty or, for `unavailable`, take the whole page down.
 *
 * A **dashed paper slip on soft cream** — `<EmptyState tier="slot"
 * background="cream-soft">`'s existing "held-open gap" vocabulary (already
 * used for a lineup column or an events list with nothing to show),
 * recoloured via that primitive's own named option rather than a `className`
 * override or a new primitive (#2636 finding 12).
 *
 * The slot's documented contract is `flex-1` inside a `flex` host, the same
 * one `<StandingsSection>`'s own no-table note follows — so this wraps it in
 * a `flex` div too, rather than cancelling `flex-1` with `flex-none` from
 * outside. One contract, one way of meeting it.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** a `<section>`: no `<h2>`, no `id`, no sticky-nav
 * entry. This is the one place the page's nav/render invariant intentionally
 * does not apply — see the comment beside `navItems` in `page.tsx`.
