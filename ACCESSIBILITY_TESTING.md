## Keyboard Navigation Testing

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Test all keyboard shortcuts work as expected:

| Shortcut | Action                 | Expected Result                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `←`      | Previous view          | Navigate to previous view (Cards ← Chart ← Responsibilities) |
| `→`      | Next view              | Navigate to next view (Cards → Chart → Responsibilities)     |
| `1`      | Go to Cards            | Switch to Cards (Overzicht) view                             |
| `2`      | Go to Chart            | Switch to Diagram view                                       |
| `3`      | Go to Responsibilities | Switch to Hulp view                                          |
| `/`      | Focus search           | Cursor moves to search input field                           |
| `Esc`    | Close modal            | Active modal/overlay closes                                  |
| `?`      | Show shortcuts         | Keyboard shortcuts help modal opens                          |

### Tab Order Testing

1. **Skip Link**:
   - Press `Tab` from page load
   - First focusable element should be "Ga naar hoofdinhoud" skip link
   - Skip link should be visible when focused
   - Pressing `Enter` should jump to main content

2. **Navigation Order**:

   ```
   Tab Order:
   1. Skip Link
   2. Search Input
   3. View Tabs (Overzicht, Diagram, Hulp)
   4. Active View Content
      - Cards: Expandable cards in hierarchy order
      - Chart: Chart controls, nodes
      - Responsibilities: Decision tree options
   5. Mobile Bottom Navigation (mobile only)
   ```

3. **Focus Indicators**:
   - All focusable elements have visible focus ring
   - Focus ring color: KCVV green (#4acf52)
   - Focus ring width: 2px minimum
   - Focus ring offset: 2px minimum

### Keyboard-Only Navigation Test

Complete the following tasks using only keyboard:

- [ ] Navigate from search to each view using number keys
- [ ] Search for a member using `/` and arrow keys
- [ ] Open member details (in Cards view)
- [ ] Close member details using `Esc`
- [ ] Navigate through all views using arrow keys
- [ ] Open keyboard shortcuts help with `?`
- [ ] Close shortcuts help with `Esc`

## Automated Testing

### Tools

1. **axe DevTools** (Browser Extension)

   ```bash
   # Install Chrome/Firefox extension
   # Run automated scan on /club/organigram
   # Fix all critical and serious issues
   ```

2. **Lighthouse** (Chrome DevTools)

   ```bash
   # Run Lighthouse audit
   # Target: Accessibility score > 95
   # Check: Performance, Best Practices, SEO
   ```

3. **WAVE** (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)
   ```bash
   # Install browser extension
   # Scan organigram page
   # Verify no errors, minimal alerts
   ```

### Automated Test Commands

```bash
# Type checking
npm run type-check

# ESLint (accessibility rules)
npm run lint

# Unit tests (including a11y tests)
npm run test

# Build (catches accessibility JSX issues)
npm run build
```

### Jest/Vitest Accessibility Tests

Example test cases:

```typescript
describe('Organigram Accessibility', () => {
  it('has no accessibility violations', async () => {
    const { container } = render(<UnifiedOrganigramClient />);
    const results = await axe(container);
    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
  });

  it('skip link is first focusable element', () => {
    render(<UnifiedOrganigramClient />);
    const skipLink = document.querySelector('a[href="#organigram-main-content"]');
    userEvent.tab();
    expect(skipLink).toHaveFocus();
  });

  it('announces view changes', () => {
    render(<UnifiedOrganigramClient />);
    const announcer = screen.getByRole('status');
    // Change view
    expect(announcer).toHaveTextContent('Weergave gewijzigd naar');
  });
});
```
