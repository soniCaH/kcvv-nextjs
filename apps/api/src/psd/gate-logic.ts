/**
 * PSD gate — pure coordination logic.
 *
 * The PSD read path storms its own quota: without coordination, N concurrent
 * cache-misses each fire the ~19-call `getNextMatches` fan-out, and a failed
 * refresh never advances `fetchedAt`, so every subsequent request re-fans out
 * until PSD recovers (see #2320). PSD's published limits are 5 req/s + 2 000/day
 * (#2319), shared across every read endpoint — one fan-out already saturates the
 * per-second budget, so the 2nd concurrent miss 429s instantly.
 *
 * This module is the storm fix, expressed as framework-free logic so it can be
 * unit-tested in the Node test env (a real Durable Object cannot). The
 * `PsdGate` Durable Object (see gate.ts) hosts ONE instance of this class, which
 * makes both limiters **global across all worker isolates**:
 *
 *  - **Call pacer** — hands out ≤`ratePerSecond` PSD calls/second worldwide, so
 *    a fan-out can't burst past PSD's 5/s ceiling. In-memory per-isolate was
 *    ruled out (#2324): 8 isolates × 5/s = 40/s.
 *  - **Single-flight** — the first caller for a cache key becomes the leader and
 *    runs the fan-out; concurrent callers coalesce (N misses → 1 fan-out).
 *
 * The persisted negative marker that suppresses re-storming lives in KV (it must
 * outlive a single DO instance), not here — see cache/kv-cache.ts.
