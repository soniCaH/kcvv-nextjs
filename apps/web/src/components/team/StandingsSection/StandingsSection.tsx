/**
 * The content of `#klassement` — N league tables under one section (#2631).
 *
 * Never two sections: #2540 gives `#klassement` exactly one `<h2>`, one
 * `StripedSeam` and one nav entry, and splitting the phases into two sections
 * breaks that invariant. The `<h2>` itself landed with the rest of the
 * heading sweep (#2637) — rendered by `page.tsx` via `<SectionHeader>`
 * immediately above this component, not inside it (`page.tsx` already has
 * the resolved `klassementLabel`, so this component doesn't need one).
 *
 * The parent only mounts this component once the competitive block's fixture
 * gate is open (#2636) — so unlike before #2636, this component never auto-
 * hides itself. `#klassement` shows the clubs it has and the numbers it has,
 * and it never says a table is coming (#2605): no rows yet renders a present-
 * tense note in its own voice rather than a bare `null`.
 *
 * Each table decides its own numberless/live render from its own `entries`
 * (`<StandingsTable>`, via `isNumberlessTable`) — this component does not
 * compute or pass that verdict. A youth side past the winter break can have
 * a scored autumn poule next to an unplayed spring one, and a single
 * block-level verdict applied to both would render the unplayed poule as a
 * full table of position-0 zeroes (#2636 finding 4 / finding 9).
