/**
 * Dutch type label for a news card's mono meta row.
 *
 * `card-semantics-locked.md` §"Card meta row & footer" specifies that row as
 * `${variant} · ${date}` — "Transfer · Vr 9 mei". Only the two match variants
 * ever shipped it (5.d-mat-refine Card B). #2404 added `transfer` because the
 * homepage grid paints that type `jersey-deep` for the locked "green =
 * transfer" semantic, and a reader who has not learned the pattern — or cannot
 * see the green — had no signal at all.
 *
 * The label is not scoped to that grid, though the green is what forced the
 * question. `/nieuws` renders every card on cream and gets the word too, on the
 * same reasoning the two match variants already carry it there: the type is
 * worth naming wherever the card appears, and one helper that answers
 * differently per surface would be the harder thing to keep honest.
 *
 * Known cost, shared with `matchPreview` / `matchRecap` since 5.d: an article
 * whose first CMS tag repeats the type renders `● TRANSFER  TRANSFERS` — the
 * `typeLabel` and the tag `MonoLabel` sit side by side in `<NewsCard>`'s label
 * row. That is a `<NewsCard>` question (which of the two wins when they say the
 * same thing), not this lookup's.
 *
 * Still `undefined` for `interview` / `announcement` / `event` and for legacy
 * untyped articles. Naming every type is a card-semantics decision of its own
 * and would put a second mono label beside the CMS tag on every card in the
 * grid — the cost above, paid six times over.
