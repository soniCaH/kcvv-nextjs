# Block a `git commit` that would land on main/master. Worktree-aware.
#
# This is the fast, friendly layer: it fails early with a helpful message
# before the tool call runs. `.husky/branch-guard.sh` is the real backstop —
# it runs inside git and cannot be routed around by a command string at all.
#
# Design notes (#2361):
#   - The tool payload is parsed as JSON, never with sed. A `"` anywhere in the
#     command used to truncate the old parse and silently disarm the guard.
#   - The command is scanned segment-by-segment (split on && || ; | parens) so
#     `cd` can appear anywhere, not only first, and the LAST `cd` before the
#     commit wins. An explicit `git -C <dir>` overrides it.
#   - Unresolvable targets (`cd $VAR`, missing dir) FAIL CLOSED.
#
# Known residual gaps, all covered by .husky/branch-guard.sh: a subshell `cd`
# that does not persist — `( cd $WT ) && git commit` — `xargs git commit`, and
# shell aliases or functions. Closing those needs a real shell parser.

# Same escape hatch as .husky/branch-guard.sh, for an exported variable. The

# paying for an interpreter. Only the trailing boundary is checked: this scans
# the raw JSON, where `git<TAB>commit` arrives as the six characters `git\tco…`
# — a leading boundary would read the `t` of `\t` as a word character and wave
# the command through.
