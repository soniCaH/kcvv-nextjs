/**
 * Deterministic per-player figure variance for `<JerseyIllustration>` (#2635),
 * hardcoded to that component's 220×300 full-figure viewBox and this exact
 * lever set — it is not a general containment mechanism. `<JerseyShirt>`
 * crops to a different viewBox (`0 120 220 180`) and could not reuse it.
 *
 * A player with no photo used to draw the identical constant figure, so a
 * squad of 26 read as 26 copies. This module derives a per-player variant —
 * registration offset, opacity, scale, crop, mirror, head/shoulder/torso
 * geometry, sleeve length and shirt pattern — from a djb2 hash of a stable
 * per-player seed (`playerFigureSeed`, below — an id, never a display
 * name), so the same player draws the same figure every render, every
 * season, and server and client agree (no `Math.random`, no DOM
 * measurement anywhere in this file).
 *
 * The lever ranges and the two-part containment guard are ported verbatim
 * from the design drill that decided them:
 *  - `docs/design/mockups/2542-squad-photo-coverage/2542-2-variatie-studie.html`
 *    — the seed, the PRNG, the lever ranges, and the top/side guard (#2542's
 *    addendum: shrink-to-fit, then shift so no shoulder or the head crosses
 *    the 4px margin, at most 8 passes).
 *  - `docs/design/mockups/2590-non-cutout-photos/2590-1-niet-uitgeknipt.html`
 *    — the bottom clamp (#2590's correction): after the existing passes, if
 *    the torso stops short of the viewBox bottom, shift down to meet it.
 *    Shifting down can never re-expose the top guard, so it runs once,
 *    un-looped, after the 8-pass loop settles.
 *
 * The PRNG draw order matches the mockups exactly — including a `scale`
 * draw that gets immediately superseded by a wider one later — so a given
 * seed maps to the same visual result the drill measured its verified
 * numbers against (0 clipped, 15-of-26-short → 0). Those numbers are a
 * property of the lever ranges plus the guard, not of any particular seed
 * sample — switching the seed source (from a display name to a stable id,
 * per code review) changes which look a given player draws, not whether
 * the guard holds.
