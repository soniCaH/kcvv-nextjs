// documented corner-anchor override (140px) bracket that number, so 128px
// keeps every artefact in this same visual register across subject kinds.
// `<Crest>`'s `size` prop takes the number directly.
//
// The class only uses `max-h-*`/`max-w-*` against `<JerseyShirt>`'s baked-in
// `h-60 w-60` — a *different* CSS property, so it composes instead of
// racing the default on Tailwind's generated stylesheet order the way a
// same-property override (`h-32`/`w-32`, or `h-full`/`w-full`) would and
// silently lose. See `<JerseyShirt>`'s own docblock before changing this.
// The two constants below encode the same 128px — Tailwind's spacing scale
// (`32` → `8rem` → 128px) has no token → arbitrary-class helper to derive
// one from the other, so keep them in sync by hand if this number changes.

/**

 * § "The Imageless Card" for the design rules this implements (#2462,

 * own hatch stays whatever it already defaults to.
 *
 * Every branch is wrapped in one `relative h-full w-full` container, so the
 * returned node is self-positioning — a caller doesn't size or position it.
 *
 * Do not add crest detection here (byte-hashing, redirect-target checks,
 * `?v=` sniffing, a deny-list). #2472's resolution comment records six
 * variants tried and rejected; a missing or wrong crest is upstream PSD
 * data work, not a render-time concern.
