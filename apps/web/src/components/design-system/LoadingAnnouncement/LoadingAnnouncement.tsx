 * `aria-live` only (2), and nothing at all (9) — leaving a screen-reader user
 * in silence through a multi-second BFF read on nine routes. `label` is the
 * only thing that may vary between call sites.
 *
 * Always render this OUTSIDE any `aria-hidden="true"` wrapper — the visual
 * skeleton bars are hidden from assistive tech, but the announcement is the
 * one thing in a `loading.tsx` that must not be.
